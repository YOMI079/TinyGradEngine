# TinyGradEngine
A minimalistic gradient cmputaotion library implemented from scratch. This project is inspired by the idea of creating a lightweight, educational deep learning tool to understand the foundations of automatic differentiation and backpropagation.

## Features

- **Automatic Differentiation:** Perform efficient backpropagation for scalar values.
- **Educational:** Written in a clear and concise manner to help understand the basics of gradient computation.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal codebase to focus on core concepts.

## Project Structure

- **Code Cells:** Contains the core implementation of the TinyGradEngine library.
- **Markdown Cells:** Provides explanations and context for the code.
- **Examples:** Demonstrates the usage of the library for gradient computation and simple optimization tasks.
